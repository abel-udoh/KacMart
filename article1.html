                Agricultural Challenges in Kenya
                Kenya’s agriculture sector faces several challenges that hinder its growth and productivity. Some of the major hurdles include small landholdings, inadequate access to modern machinery and technology, outdated farming methods, climate change impact, and limited access to credit for farmers. These obstacles contribute to low agricultural productivity and hamper the nation’s overall development.
        
                The Role of Agricultural Machinery
                Agricultural machinery has proven to be a game-changer in transforming traditional farming practices into more efficient and productive ones. Mechanized agriculture enhances productivity, reduces labor-intensive tasks, and optimizes the utilization of resources, ultimately leading to increased yields and profitability for farmers.
